üè† ``HttpxLibrary`` is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) library
aimed to provide HTTP api testing functionalities by wrapping the well known [Python httpx Library](https://www.python-httpx.org/).

## Install stable version
```sh
pip install robotframework-httpx
```

## ‚ú® Install latest 0.9 pre-release (alpha) version ‚ú®
```sh
pip install robotframework-httpx --pre
```

### What's new in 0.9 pre-release
Session less keywords are now available, you can just `GET`, `POST`, etc.. without creating a session before!
```robotframework
${resp}=  GET  https://www.google.com
```
See the full [0.9 Keywords documentation](https://robotframework-requests.netlify.app/doc/requestslibrary)

### What's new in 0.8

**New keywords structure:**
All requests keywords have been rewritten because of many not backward compatible changes
and to allow in the near future requests keywords without a session.
Example `Get Request` become `GET On Session` and soon there will be also just `GET` 
when a session is not needed.
Old keywords `* Request` are now deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.0 version.

**Implicit assert on status code:**
`* On Session` keywords automatically fail if an error status code is returned.
`expect_status=` could be used to specify a status code (`201`, `OK`, `Bad request`) 
or `any` if you want to evaluate the response in any case. 

**Closer to the original Requests library:**
New keywords have the same parameter orders and structure as the original.
Lot of pre-parsing / encoding has been removed to have a more accurate and unchanged behaviour.

**Cleaner project architecture:**
Main keywords file has been split with a more logic division to allow better and faster maintenance.
